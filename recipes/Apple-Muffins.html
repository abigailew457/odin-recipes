        <p>
            This muffin recipe from 
            <a href="https://www.rainbownourishments.com/vegan-apple-muffins/">
                Rainbow Nourishments</a> has a special place in my heart. 
                It is one of the first recipes I had the opportunity to make and share 
                with my fellow teachers while living in Korea. The bold cinnamon flavor 
                and fluffy texture made it easy to fall in love with these muffins.

            Like every recipe I love, this one is easy to create and quick to clean.
            Simply combine all the ingredients and bake. This recipe will take you from craving
            to eating so quickly you'll never let it go.
