            This muffin recipe from 
            <a href="https://www.rainbownourishments.com/vegan-apple-muffins/">
                Rainbow Nourishments</a> has a special place in my heart. 
                It is one of the first recipes I had the opportunity to make and share 
                with my fellow teachers while living in Korea. The bold cinnamon flavor 
                and fluffy texture made it easy to fall in love with these muffins.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Dry ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>290 g all-purpose plain flour</li>
            <li>145 g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Pinch of any good-quality salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Wet ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium-sized apple, chopped roughly or finely</li>
            <li>250 g dairy-free milk</li>
            <li>125 g neutral flavored oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep:</strong>
            Preheat the oven to 180c or 170c for a convection oven. 
            Line a muffin tray with liners or oil generously.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mix:</strong>
            Add all the dry ingredients to a medium or large bowl.
            Mix until there are no lumps. Next, add all of the wet ingredients to the bowl 
            (except the apple) and mix until just before it's combined.
            Then, add the chopped apple and fold until the apple is evenly dispersed.
            Finally, use a large spoon to divide the batter into your muffin tin.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong>
            Bake the muffins in the oven for 20-25 minutes OR until a skewer can be
            inserted into the middle and there is no wet batter on it, though some crumbs are fine.
            Cool the muffins in their tray for 10 minutes then allow them to cool on a wire rack.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong>
                The muffins can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature 
                for 2 days in the fridge for 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.
