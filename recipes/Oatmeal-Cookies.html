           These quick and easy oatmeal cookies, like many of my favorite recipes, are from 
           <a href="https://www.rainbownourishments.com/vegan-oatmeal-cookies/#recipe">
            Rainbow Nurishments.</a> Rainbow Nourishments has been consistent 
            in providing not only easy but delicious vegan alternatives to many 
            of my favorite recipes. I always trust any dish by Anthea has been well 
            thought out and tastes incredible.

            These oatmeal cookies are soft and chewy, made from common ingredients, and 
            require no chilling time. So sit back and relax with this one bowl recipe. 
            Not only easy to make but easy to clean.
