        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>145 g packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>115 g vegan butter, softened</li>
            <li>25 g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>30 g dairy-free milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>95 g all-purpose plain flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>Pinch of any good quality salt</li>
            <li>180 g rolled oats</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep:</strong>
                Preheat the oven to 180c or 170c for a convection oven. 
                Line 2 large baking trays with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mix:</strong>
                Add the butter, brown and granulated sugars to a large mixing bowl.
                Use an electric hand mixer to whisk until fluffy and well combined.
                Add the vanilla extract and milk then whisk until just combined.
                Next, add the flour, cinnamon, 
                baking soda and salt then mix until well combined.
                Finally, add the oats and mix until just combined. If the mixture is dry, 
                add an extra 1-2 tablespoons of milk and mix until combined.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Divide:</strong>
                Use a small cookie scoop or a tablespoon measure to divide
                the cookie dough into 15 balls (around 40g each). 
                Arrange the balls on your lined baking sheets, leaving around 2 inches
                between them as they will spread. Optional: for slightly thinner cookies,
                slightly flatten each ball with your fingers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong>
                Bake the cookies for around 11-15 minutes. For soft chewy cookies, 
                bake the cookies for less time. They will look unbaked when you remove them
                from the oven, but they will continue baking on the tray! For crispy cookies,
                bake the cookies for longer. Enjoy the cookies warm or at room temperature.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong>
                Store leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week,
                in the fridge for up to 2 weeks or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
