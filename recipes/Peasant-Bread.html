        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>512 g unbleached all-purpose or bread flour</li>
            <li>10 g kosher salt</li>
            <li>454 g lukewarm water 
                (made by mixing 1.5 cups cold water with 0.5 cup boiling water)</li>
            <li>8 g sugar</li>
            <li>8 g instant yeast</li>
            <li>room temperature vegan butter of choice, about 2 tablespoons</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mixing the dough:</strong>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together
                 the flour, salt, sugar, and instant yeast. Add the water. 
                 Mix until the flour is absorbed.</li>
            <li><strong>First rise:</strong>
                Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot to rise for 
                at least an hour. (In the winter or if you are letting the bread rise 
                in a cool place, it might take as long as two hours to rise.)</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat:</strong>
            Preheat the oven to 218c. If using a convection oven, preheat to 208c.
            Grease a 12 cup muffin tin with about two tablespoons of butter.
            Using two forks, punch down your dough, scraping it from the sides of the bowl, 
            which it will be clinging to. As you scrape it down try to pull the dough toward the center. 
            You want to loosen the dough entirely from the sides of the bowl, 
            and you want to make sure you’ve punched it down.
            Then, take your two forks and divide the dough equal into the greased muffin tin.</li>
            <li><strong>Second rise:</strong>
                Let the dough rise again for about 20 to 30 minutes on the
                countertop near the oven (or near a warm spot) or until it has risen to just
                below or above the top of the bowls.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake it:</strong>
                Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 190c (180c for convection oven) 
                and bake for 15 to 17 minutes longer. 
                Remove from the oven and turn the loaves onto cooling racks.
                If you’ve greased the bowls well, the loaves should fall right out onto the cooling racks.
                If the loaves look a little pale and soft when you’ve turned them out
                onto your cooling racks, place the loaves into the oven (outside of their bowls)
                and let them bake for about 5 minutes longer. 
                Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
